# Embedded-System-Project

Editing the rc.local file using the command below the RaspBerry Pi code will be executed automatically
sudo nano /etc/rc.local

All that needs to be done is add the path to the file to be executed, in our case the following script was used and whenever the RaspBerry Pi is booted the main.py script runs.

python3 home/pi/Embedded-System-Project/main.py
